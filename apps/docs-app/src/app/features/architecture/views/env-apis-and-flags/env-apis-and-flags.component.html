  <section>
    <p>
      Developing an Angular application is a lot like survival: there are millions of way to do it, but it's always better to make use of
      your environment. The most typical use-case is to define you base api like so:
    </p>

    <app-code-block [code]="env1"></app-code-block>

    <p>This is quite practical but we can do even better with some proxy !</p>
  </section>

  <h2 class="mat-h2" appAnchor>Proxy</h2>
  <section>
    <p>
      A really nice thing to use is webpack's proxy that is integrated inside angular/cli. It can be as simple as below and like that, we
      have a cleaner environment to leave for future generations.
    </p>
    <div fxLayout="row wrap" fxLayoutAlign="space-around">
      <app-code-block language="javascript" [code]="proxyConf"></app-code-block>
      <app-code-block [code]="env2"></app-code-block>
      <app-code-block [code]="packageJson" language="json"></app-code-block>
    </div>
  </section>

  <h2 class="mat-h2" appAnchor>Env flags and routing</h2>
  <section>
    <p>
      You can adapt your application's content by using your environment directly in
      <app-inline-code>app-routing.module.ts</app-inline-code>, like here:
    </p>
    <app-code-block url="assets/src/app/app-routing.module.ts"></app-code-block>
  </section>
