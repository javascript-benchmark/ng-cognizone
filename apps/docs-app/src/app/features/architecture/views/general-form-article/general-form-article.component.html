  <p>
    In angular, there are 2 main ways to create forms: the <a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/FormsModule">template driven way</a> and
    the <a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/ReactiveFormsModule">reactive form way</a>. Both ways have their own merits, but we are going
    to focus on the reactive forms.
